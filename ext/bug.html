<h1>Snippy Bugs</h1>
<p>
  This page is (not) intentionally left blank. I'll update with information on how to report bugs (especially
  about pages where snippet grabbing is difficult) as soon as possible.
</p>
<h2>Known bugs</h2>
<p>
  <b>When I click the <i>Snip it</i> button nothing happens!</b>
</p>
<p>
  Make sure the webpage you want to grab snippets from if fully loaded. Snippy won't start working until the page finished loading.
  Wait for the little spinning icon (which is displayed in the tab title while a page loads) to go away before activating snippy. 
</p>
<p>
  Also note that Snippy is enabled only for unsecured webpages (pages that are not served with the https protocol). It won't work,
  for instance, on your bank account internet portal.
</p>

<p>
 <b>Snippy grabbed some content, but it's no longer there and/or is not available to others I've shared it with</b>
</p>
<p>
  Snippy copies the contents of the page you're looking at as they are. In particular, it hotlinks all the external resources, such as images.
  Contents that live in protected areas opened only to you (such as your personal mail or your Facebook profile) may not be available to
  other people (or even to you when you log out of such websites) after you've grabbed them with Snippy.
