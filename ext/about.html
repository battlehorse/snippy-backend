<h1>About Snippy</h1>

<p>
<b>Snippy</b> is a Chrome Extension that allows you to save important snippets you find online.
Be it a new laptop or book you just spotted on Amazon, a set of interesting Tweets, a Wikipedia excerpt or
even some citations from PubMed, use <b>Snippy</b> to collect them all.
</p>

<p>
Just go to a webpage of your choice and activate <b>Snippy</b> clicking the icon in the toolbar and then the <i>Snip it!</i>
button. Then move your mouse over items you find interesting and click them. They will be immediately stored in your snippets!
</p>

<p>
Click the toolbar icon again and now choose <i>Show snippets</i> to review what you have collected so far. Snippets are automatically
saved locally in your browser, so you won't lose them when you close Chrome.
</p>

<p>
If you want, you can also save your snippets online (via <a href="http://snipbin.appspot.com">SnipBin</a>) and share them with the world.
You'll find all the instructions in the <i>Show snippets</i> page.
